2016 => .NET Core 1.0 
Cross Platform => Win, Mac, Linux
Open Source, GitHub, Modul bases and Cloud Ready

2021 => .NET 6, C# 10, ASP.NET Core 6 (Web App, Web API), Entity Framework Core 6 (ORM => database) => 2 weeks 

ASP.NET Core => Web

ASP.NET Core MVC

Key Concepts =>
Model
View => UI Elements => button, input, radio buttons, dropdownns =>
		HTML => CSS, JS  [ Tag Helpers and HTML Helpers => MVC Specific => Converted to HTML and send to the browser ]
	 => Browser =>
Controller

HTTP => GET (Browser)

ASP.NET Core => respond to the request

ASP.NET MVC
Terminal 
Postman =>

C#, Java, Python HTTP 

Domain GET
http://www.example.com/employee/details/22
http://www.example.com/employee/Top30SalaryEmployees

// create a new employee
http://www.example.com/employee/create

1. URL meaningful =>
 1 part is Domian
 2nd part is MVC Controller
 
 
 C# class that inherits from Controller 
 
 // MVC Controller
 public class EmployeeController : Controller
 {
 
   [HttpGet]
   public IActionResult Create() 
   {
		return View();
   }
   
   [HttpPost]
   public IActionResult Create(Employee employee) 
   {
		// save to databsae
		// return View("Home");
   }
 
	// will have multiple action methods
	// Action method name should be matching with 3rd part of the URL
	// Attributes in C#
	[HttpGet]
	public IActionResult Details(int id) 
	{
		// Logic
		//.. go to database and get employee details for 22
		// Model = represents the data that you need for the View
		// Entities => represents the columns/properties Tables
		var employeeDetails = EmployeeService.GetEmployeeDetails(id);
		return View(employeeDetails);
		
	}
	
	[HttpGet]
	public IActionResult Top30SalaryEmployees () 
	{
		var employees = EmployeeService.GetTopEmployees();
		return View(employees);
		
	}
	
	}
	// Entity class
	public class Employee 
	{
		// 20 prepoties
	}
	
	// Model
	public class EmployeeDetailsResponseModel 
	{
		// 5 properties
	}
	
	
 }


Make sure our code is peoperly strucutred and should be maintanable and testable, loosly coupled 
Clean-architecture, Onion Architecture, n-Layer architecture

1. ApplicationCore is the base of your projet => it does not have any dependencies on any other projects
	Entities
	Models
	Helpers
	Interfaces => Repository Interfaces, Service Interfaces

2. Infrastructure => Reference ApplicationCore
	Data Logic (Implentation of Repository Interfaces) => Savin to database, getting data from database, Repostory classes
	Service - Business Logic ((Implentation of Service Interfaces)) => Registring User, Hash his/her password, sending emails,  

3. UI ASP.NET MVC => References ApplicationCore and Infrastructure
		Controllers
		Views
		
in ASP.NET Core 6 version we dont have startup.cs file
in previos ASP.NET Core versions we had both program.cs and startup.cs
ASP.NET 6 Unifies Startup.cs and Program.cs into a single Program.cs file.

in older asp.net core Startup has two important methods
	1. ConfigureServices => DI
	2. Configure	=> Middlewares

Repository => Abstarct the data access Logic => They get the data from Database and map  them to Entity Classes

1. RAW => Low Level API => ADO.NET => SQLCommand, SQLConnection => execute SP, secute SQL and then map the data to object
        => Manually
2. Dapper => micro ORM => Object Relational Mapping => StackOverflow
3. Entity Framework Core =>  


Services => Contain the actual business Logic and they return the Models to the MVC App Controller

List<Movie> Entity objects   in a method => List<MovieResponseModles> Models


List<MovieCardResponseModel>

public class MovieCardResponseModel 
{
	Id
	Title
	PosterUrl
}


Depedency Injection => First Class Citizen in .NET Core

Tigtly Coupled Code, hard to test and maintain and add any addi
new() convinient => 

Higheer Level Abstactions


IMovieRepository : IRepository
{
	7 methods
}

MovieRepostory : IMovieRepository 
{
	Implentation 7 methods
	EF Core to access the database
	SQL Server
}

DapperMovieReposiroy: IMovieRepository 
{
	// Dapper with Postgres Databse
}


1. Create an Abstractions => interfaces
2. Use Constructor INjection, create private readonly filed for the interfaces
	Inject the actual implementation with DI from Startup/Program.cs
	You can change the implementations as needed


3 ways => 99 % Constructor INjection
			Method Injection
			Property INjetion

HomeController controller = new HomeController(new );

.NET Framework they didn;t had DI support built-in
3rdy party DI IOC
Autofac
Ninject

20 controller in ASP.NET

3 controllers wanna use MOvieService for IMovieService
4 controllers wanna use MovieMOckService for IMovieService

TO Access any Database in C#, 
1. ADO.NET
2. ORM option
	micro ORM => Dapper
	ORM=> Entity Framework


ADO.NET
	1. Make sure you have database ready
	2. To get any data from database we need to use classes such as SqlConnection, SqlCommand, then execute them and
		map the SQL data to the objects
	3. You need to write lots of repeated code through out your application, takes lots of time for larger application
    4. Performance wise very good
ORM
	Dapper- micro ORM
		1. Make sure you have database ready
		2. Built on top of ADO.NET classes, they are collection of extension methods
		3. You need to write SQL Statements and write SP
		4. Mapping of the objects is done easily by dapper.(saves the time)
		5. Performance wise as good as ADO.NET

	Entity Framework
		1. You can create a complete database without writing single line of SQL Code, by using just C# 
			objects and some special classes in EF using Migrations.
		2. You dont need to write any SP, SQL statements to get the data, write LINQ and have EF transalte the LINQ to SQL
			and it will exeute and automatically map the data to C# objects
		3. EF performce is a bit slower compared to dapper or ado.net but EF Core 6, its performance is as good as Dapper
			in lots of cases
		4. If youn write in-efficient LINQ statements => then EF will generate in-efficient SQL statements.


		EF has two most imporant classes
		1. DbContext => Represents your database
		2. DbSet => Represents your Table

Steps for Creating the Database using EF Core
	we had two approaches to use EF
	1. *** Code-First approach => Create the databse with C# code and use EF ***
	2. Database-First approach => you need to have database already created and then use EF 

	1. Extension methods
	2. Func and Action delegates
	3. LINQ methods => 
		1. First()
		2. FirstOrDefault()
		3. Single()
		4. SingleOrDefault()
		5. Where()
		6. Any()
		7. GroupBy()
		8. Select()
	4. Anonymous Types and methods


EF Core to create the Database, Migrations to create/change database

1. Configure the connection string in our application so that we can use that connection string with EF
    1. SQL Server name, database name, authentication
2. We configure connection string inside the appsettings.json
3. DbContext=> represents our database and DbSet=> Represents our table
4. Install required Entity Framework Packages EF Core, EF Core SQl Server, Ef Core design
in both Infrastructure and MVC projects 
Create our custom DbContext class that inherits from DbContext class
5. Inject the connection string into the MovieShopSbContext constructor using DbContextOptions from 
Startup or Program.cs file
6. Create our Genre Table, ORM (Object Relational Mapping) by creating Genre Entity (object) with all the required
properties based on columns
7. Create the DbSet property for the entities
8. Create your very first migration
9. EF has convention where if you have a property called Id then it will by default make it as PK
10. Run update database to execute the migration 
11. WE have DataAnnotations and Fluent API to model our database and table
12. Whenever you change your entity/model with DataAnnotations or Fluent API, make sure you add a new Migration
and update-database, always give meaningful name to your migrations, do not give xyz, abc, test names
13. To create Many - Many relationship we need Junction table in Relational database


EF COre 5 and before when we have aproperty of string

		public string Title { get; set; } // it created them as nullable types in SQL Server
        public string Overview { get; set; }



Architecture of our Project

Step 1 : Create Repository Interface based on your needs (repo per table), IGenreRepository, IUserRepository that inherits from IRepository, inside ApplicationCore 
project, inside RepositoryInterfaces folder
Step 2 : Implement Repository interfaces inside the Infrastructure project inside Repository folder and make sure the repositories inherut from base Repository<T>
		Replace T with the entity type for example MovieRepository will inherit from Repository<Movie>
Step 3: Create Service Interfaces (business logic) inside the ServiceInterfaces folder in ApplicationCore Project for ex: IMovieService, IGenreService
		Services should always return Models rather than Entities, create Required Models inside th Models foolder such as GenreModel, MovieCardResponseModel etc
Step 4: Implement Services inside the services folder inside Infrstructure Project, Services will use DI with repository interfaces
		Register DI for both Repositories and Services intefaces in the Program.cs or startup.cs (.NET 5 and older)
Step 5 : Call the services with DI from the required Controllers. For example HomeController will use MovieService with DI of IMovieService
